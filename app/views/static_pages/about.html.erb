  Assignment Management System (AMS) is created to facilitate students in managing their assignments. Although the initial plan of mine is to create a Teaching Learning Facilitating System (TLFS), due to time constraint, I eventually could only implement part of it, which is the AMS.<br><br><br>
  After signing up and logging into the system, students can add assignments including title, content as well as upload assignment file to the system. Besides adding, users can also see list of all assignments as well as edit and remove assignments. In home page of each individual user, there is ‘Soon Due / Due Assignment’ in which user can see list of their soon reaching deadline assignments (less than 14 days) or assignments that are already due. On the right side, there is a ‘Stats’ box which indicates total assignments current user has as well as how many he/she has not yet done. Users can also change their password in the account setting. Users with administrator privilege can also see all users and remove the users from the system.<br><br><br>
  The website has been designed using bootstrap which guarantees to be fully-responsive with all kinds of platform. Various vital validations have been implemented to maximizing user-experience. More than 10 third-party libraries have been used throughout the development including will_paginate, wysiwyg-rails, font-awesome-rails, carrierwave, bootstrap-datepicker-rails, bootstrap-toggle-rails, responders, byebug, mysql2, faker, etc. System is coded neatly to ensure convenience for future maintenance.
